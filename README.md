A To-Do List Web Application is a productivity-based web project that allows users to organize their daily tasks efficiently.
This project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and demonstrates the core concepts of frontend web development such as structure, styling, and dynamic interaction.

The application allows users to:
-Add tasks
-Mark tasks as completed
-Highlight important tasks
-Delete tasks
-Track progress visually
The project is implemented as a single-page application, meaning all the code is written in one HTML file for simplicity and ease of understanding.

1.HTML
In this project, HTML is responsible for:
-Creating the heading “To-Do List”
-Designing the input box for adding tasks
-Creating buttons and containers
-Displaying the task list dynamically

2.CSS
In this project, CSS is used for:
-Background gradient similar to the given design
-Dark brown color for the heading
-Rounded input box with grey border
-Yellow highlight for pinned (important) tasks
-Styling buttons, task cards, and layout
-Creating smooth animation effects for task completion
CSS improves the user experience (UI/UX) by making the application visually appealing.

3.JavaScript
JavaScript is used to:
-Add tasks dynamically without refreshing the page
-Detect checkbox clicks and mark tasks as completed
-Display an animated “Completed” flash message
-Pin tasks as important
-Delete tasks from the list
-Update the task completion tracker in real time
JavaScript handles DOM manipulation, which allows elements to be created, modified, or removed dynamically.

4.Working of the Application
-Adding a Task : The user enters a task in the input box.
-Marking a Task as Completed : Each task has a checkbox on the left.
When checked:
The task text is struck through
A smooth animated “✔ Completed” flash message appears
The task counter updates automatically
-Pinning an Important Task : A 📌 icon is provided for each task.
When clicked:
The task background turns yellow
The task is visually marked as important
-Deleting a Task : A 🗑️ icon allows the user to remove tasks.
On clicking delete:
The task is removed from the list
The progress tracker updates instantly
-Deleting a Task : A 🗑️ icon allows the user to remove tasks.
On clicking delete:
The task is removed from the list
The progress tracker updates instantly
Example: 3/5 Completed
It updates automatically whenever tasks are completed or deleted.
This gives the user a clear idea of progress.
